<LI><B><I>Current Status</I></B>:Some feedback indicated that the first version of FunGEn was not as "functional" as it was desired: some game issues were still being dealt through an imperative fashion. This way, the authors of this project decided to change the game engine philosophy: programmers should describe a game as a set of "specifications" rather than defining its behavior imperatively. One plausible alternative for accomplishing this task
is porting the Clean Game Library (CGL) to Haskell, adding some FunGEn specific features. Hence, this is the actual status of the FunGEn project: it is being rebuilt in order to provide game programming mechanisms following the CGL
concepts. This really demands some time, but the authors expect a new version to be released soon.

<P><LI>
<B><I>FunGEn v1.0</I></B> can be downloaded <A HREF="download.html">here</a>. (<B><I>PLEASE NOTE</I></B>: this is the very first version of FunGEn, and it was released just to get some feedback from game programmers. You are strongly invited to <A HREF="mailto:awbf@cin.ufpe.br">tell</A> your game programming experiences with FunGEn, helping us to release a definitive, stable version). Ok, after this disclaimer, please fell yourself free to take a quick tour in the site; it contains a lot of useful information for those who are really interested in trying a new game programming experience. Nice coding...

<B><I>- What is FunGEn?</I></B>
</FONT>
<P>Welcome to the FunGEn site. FunGEn (<B>Fun</B>ctional <B>G</B>ame <B>En</B>gine) is a 2D platform-independent game engine implemented in and for Haskell, using HOpenGL. It is intended to help game programmers in the game development process, in a faster and automated way. Actually, FunGEn supports:
<UL>
	<LI> Initialization, updating, removing, rendering and grouping routines for <I>game objects</I>;
	<LI> Definition of a <I>game background</I> (or map), including texture-based maps and tile maps;
	<LI> Reading and intepretation of the player's keyboard input;
	<LI> Collision detection;
	<LI> Time-based functions and pre-defined game actions;
	<LI> Loading and displaying of 24-bit bitmap files;
	<LI> Debugging and game performance evaluation facilities;
	<LI> Sound support (actually for windows platforms only... <FONT COLOR=red><B>:-[</B></FONT> );
	<LI> Hope to expand this list soon <FONT COLOR=blue><B>:-]</B></FONT>

<B><I>- What is a game engine?</I></B>
</FONT>
<P>A game engine can be considered as a library that provides game facilities to a game programmer. When using a game engine, the programmer must specify <B>when</B> the game events happen, rather than <B>how</B> they are implemented. A same functionality may have its implementation varying from platform to platform, in the case the engine is platform-independent. The main advantage of a game engine is that it can be reused to the development of many different kind of games, in an automated way, saving a lot of programming time.

<B><I>- Why Haskell?</I></B>
</FONT>



<P>We believe that Haskell is a great language to develop games, because of its high level of abstraction and the generation of a more concise, elegant and shorter code. This is great for code maintenance and understanding. Combining the power of Haskell with the facilities provided by game engines seems a promising project. You can find more info on Haskell in its <A HREF="http://www.haskell.org" TARGET="_blank">official site</A>.

<B><I>- What is HOpenGL?</I></B>
</FONT>
<P>HOpenGL stands for <I>Haskell Open Graphics Library</I>. Actually, it is a binding to one of the most famous graphics libraries around the world (OpenGL) and its auxiliary toolkit (GLUT). In other words, it makes possible to call OpenGL/GLUT routines (which were written in the C language) when programming in Haskell. You can find more info on HOpenGL in <A HREF="http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~haskell/hopengl/" TARGET="_blank">my HOpenGL Tutorial site</A>, or in its <A HREF="http://www.haskell.org/HOpenGL" TARGET="_blank">official site</A>.
