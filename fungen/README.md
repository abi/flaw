FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a cross-platform, BSD-licensed,
OpenGL-based 2D game engine written in Haskell. It is intended to help
game programmers make games in a faster and more automated way. FunGEn
supports:

- Initialization, updating, removing, rendering and grouping routines for game objects;
- Definition of a game background (or map), including texture-based maps and tile maps;
- Reading and intepretation of the player's keyboard input;
- Collision detection;
- Time-based functions and pre-defined game actions;
- Loading and displaying of 24-bit bitmap files;
- Debugging and game performance evaluation facilities;
- Sound support (actually for windows platforms only... :-[ );
- Hope to expand this list soon :-]

## FAQ

**What is a game engine?**

A game engine can be considered as a library that provides game facilities
to a game programmer. When using a game engine, the programmer must
specify when the game events happen, rather than how they are
implemented. A same functionality may have its implementation varying from
platform to platform, in the case the engine is platform-independent. The
main advantage of a game engine is that it can be reused to the
development of many different kind of games, in an automated way, saving a
lot of programming time.

**Why Haskell?**

We believe that Haskell is a great language to develop games, because of
its high level of abstraction and the generation of a more concise,
elegant and shorter code. This is great for code maintenance and
understanding. Combining the power of Haskell with the facilities provided
by game engines seems a promising project. You can find more info on
Haskell in its official site.

**What is HOpenGL?**

HOpenGL stands for Haskell Open Graphics Library. Actually, it is a
binding to one of the most famous graphics libraries around the world
(OpenGL) and its auxiliary toolkit (GLUT). In other words, it makes
possible to call OpenGL/GLUT routines (which were written in the C
language) when programming in Haskell. You can find more info on HOpenGL
in my HOpenGL Tutorial site, or in its official site.

## Release notes

### 0.3 (2011/02/13)
GHC 6.12-compatible 0.3 [released](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/86330) on darcsden & hackage by Simon Michael:

- updated for GHC 6.12 & base 4
- module names simplified
- beginning of haddockification
- docs moved into repo
- published to darcsden, hackage, wiki, haskell-cafe, #haskell-game, reddit

### 0.1-hackage (2008/09/17)
GHC 6.10-compatible 0.1 released on hackage by Miloslav Raus:

- updated for GHC 6.10

  (at least on my shitty laptop). Weird pong paddle behavior under Win32.

### GHC 6.8 update (2008/02/26)
GHC 6.8-compatible update by Simon Michael:

- updated for GHC 6.8
- slight tweaks to examples
- public darcs repo

### 0.1 (2002)
First public release by Andre Furtado:

- FunGEn v1.0 can be downloaded here. (PLEASE NOTE: this is the very first
  version of FunGEn, and it was released just to get some feedback from
  game programmers. You are strongly invited to tell your game programming
  experiences with FunGEn, helping us to release a definitive, stable
  version). Ok, after this disclaimer, please fell yourself free to take a
  quick tour in the site; it contains a lot of useful information for
  those who are really interested in trying a new game programming
  experience. Nice coding...

- Current Status: Some feedback indicated that the first version of FunGEn
  was not as "functional" as it was desired: some game issues were still
  being dealt through an imperative fashion. This way, the authors of this
  project decided to change the game engine philosophy: programmers should
  describe a game as a set of "specifications" rather than defining its
  behavior imperatively. One plausible alternative for accomplishing this
  task is porting the Clean Game Library (CGL) to Haskell, adding some
  FunGEn specific features. Hence, this is the actual status of the FunGEn
  project: it is being rebuilt in order to provide game programming
  mechanisms following the CGL concepts. This really demands some time,
  but the authors expect a new version to be released soon.

## Contributing

Andre's 2002 todo list:

Here you have a list of some upcoming FunGEn features, and some other
desired features (but with no implementation prevision yet).

- Support map scrolling (coming soon);
- Support mouse input management (coming soon);
- Make a polygon map definition avaiable (coming soon);
- Make sound avaible to non-Win32 platforms;
- Create, if possible, some operators to avoid the excessive (x <- ...) syntax;
- Support auto-animated objects;
- Create a GLUT independent font support (or perhaps extend it);
- Improve the installation process;
- Upgrade FunGEn to be both a 2D (bidimensional) and 2D 1/2 (bi and a half dimensional) engine;
- Create a map editor/generator (possibly in other language, or using the brand new Haskell GUI...);
- Take courage to start thinking about the 3D world...

Would you like to suggest a feature? Feel free to do it. Would you like to
implement a feature? Please do it! Keep in touch.

FunGEn was created by Andre Furtado, Computation Science graduation
student at the Informatics Center (CIn) of the Federal University of
Pernambuco (UFPE), as part of a Scientific Iniciation (PIBIC/CNPq)
research project (Creating a Game Platform Using Haskell), oriented by
lecturer Andre Santos (PhD, 1995, University of Glasgow), who was
responsible for figuring out a lot of FunGEn implementation details.

I would like to thank also the following people who contributed for the development of FunGEn:
